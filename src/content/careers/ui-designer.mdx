<p className="desc">
  Why we want to hire someone for this position? We’ve grown very dynamically in
  the last year (from 3 people organization into a company of 14) what’s been
  constantly posing new challenges in front of us. We’ve been focusing solely on
  the web development side of things thus far, but we see a tremendous potential
  to ship even more value to our customers if we do the design part right as
  well (often times, we receive an UI designed poorly that we have to implement)
</p>

We want to solve this problem and create awesome products for our customers: ship beautifully designed UI that’s engineered and developed in a perfect way.

Once hired, you’ll work directly with our project manager and developers.
