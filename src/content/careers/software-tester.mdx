<p className="desc">
  Whenever you write a new line of code, you also potentially add new bugs.
  That’s especially (and painfully) true when you’re working as a team on
  several different projects at the same time.
</p>
We treat our Software Tester as a watchful investigator whose efforts are a crucial
factor in delivering better and reliable web apps. As the second Tester within Bejamas,
you will get a chance to test (ha!) your new ideas, setting up a new bunch of rules
if needed, and teach us about the quality standards.

In the nearest future, we have a plan to prepare test cases and implement automation tests for all clients’ projects on a regular basis.
