If 'good enough' design implementations aren’t good enough for you and you feel anxious when you see red and yellow lighthouse results then don't contemplate any longer about applying for this position.

- At least 2 years of proven commercial experience in developing user interfaces using React.js
- Experience working with git in real projects
- High attention to detail
- Experience working in an kanban and scrum development process
- Written and spoken English at a level high-enough to be able to communicate smoothly with the rest of the team
- Experience in working with REST/GraphQL APIs
- Basic understanding of tools such as Sketch, Figma, InVision or Zeplin

Would be great to see:

- hands-on experience with tools like Gatsby and Next.js
- ability to connect headless CMS systems such as Contentful, NetlifyCMS, Storyblok or Prismic with a JAMstack site
- track records of remote work in your career history
  experience with node.js
